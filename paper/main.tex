\begin{abstract}
	Nowadays, a need to analyze more complex data arises.
	Some objects and relations can not be represented as vectors in Euclidean space, and, therefore, we have to consider graphs --- sets of nodes and connections between them --- as a subject of analysis.
	They are able to hold more information than traditional Euclidean object --- for example, nodes and edges may have their own features.
	It is also possible to extract topological information from a graph --- by determining its `shape' we can understand the relation between nodes and somehow make use of this information.

	This poses a huge problem: we have to invent new algorithms, adapt known techniques and constantly improve them in order to work with such a complex data.
	Our goal is to research the efficiency of several tweaks of existing models and means of preprocessing graphs in order to increase several key indicators.
